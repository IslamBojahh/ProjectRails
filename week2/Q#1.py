# Define a class named Shape and its subclasses Square and Circle. Each shape will have a method of area and a method of perimeter (default value of both is 0).
#The Square class has an init function which takes a length as an argument
#The Circle class has an init function which takes a radius as an argument
#Add also a representation method for each shape.
#Donâ€™t forget to use private variables where needed, and use inheritance and overriding where needed!
